PandaBoard and PandaBoard ES are both supported
by FreeBSD-CURRENT.

I've only started experimenting very recently, so don't
yet know how mature that support is.  Ask on the freebsd-arm
or freebsd-current mailing list if you're interested in
getting more information from other users of this board.

================================================================

What is PandaBoard?
--------------------------------

PandaBoard and PandaBoard ES are full-featured ARM-based
development and test boards designed by the Pandaboard
project.  Details can be found at:

  http://pandaboard.org

The PandaBoard ES features a dual-core Cortex-A9 processor
(ARMv7) with 1 GB RAM, 10/100 Ethernet, WiFi, Bluetooth,
audio, integrated video with hardware 3D acceleration,
and USB support all built in.

================================================================

How to Boot the PandaBoard
--------------------------------

1. CONNECT the DB-9 serial port on the board
   to your FreeBSD system using a serial cable
   or serial-to-USB adapter.

2. ACCESS the serial console.

3. INSERT the SDHC card into your PandaBoard.

4. POWER your board by connecting a 5v power supply.
