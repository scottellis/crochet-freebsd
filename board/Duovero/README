The Duovero is not explicitly supported by FreeBSD-CURRENT.
The PANDABOARD machine is similar enough that the kernel boots
a basic system.

Just getting started on this port.
================================================================

What is a Duovero?
--------------------------------

Manufactured by Gumstix, the Duovero COMs are small form-factor
ARM boards based on the TI OMAP4430 Dual Cortex-A9 processor.

The Duovero COMS come in 2 flavors

  Duovero Crystal 
  Duovero Zephyr - adds a Marvell Wifi/Bluetooth (supports AP) 

They each come with 1 GB of memory and boot from a microSD card.

The COMs require an expansion board for operation.

I recommend the Parlor expansion board for getting started, 
particularly for access to ethernet and USB.

The Chateau expansion board gives direct access to more of the
lines coming from the COM, but are less convenient when getting
started. 

You will also require a 5V power supply from Gumstix for the
expansion board. The power jack is not the standard barrel size.
================================================================

How to Boot the Duovero 
--------------------------------

1. Get a Parlor expansion board and power supply

2. Connect a USB serial cable to the console port (next to the
   power supply jack).
 
3. The serial console setup is 115200,8N1

4. Copy the image to a microSD card 

5. Power up

PROJECTS
--------------------------------

Top priority, a proper board configuration in the FreeBSD tree.

There are some device tree configuration files in the latest Linux
kernel sources (3.17) for the Duovero and the Parlor expansion board.
I have not verified whether or how well they work. I'm currently
running an older non-DT Linux kernel on the Duoveros. This might
be a good start for the initial FreeBSD kernel configuration though.
